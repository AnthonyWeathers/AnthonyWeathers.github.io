        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            In college, I took courses geared towards being a computer engineer as I was fascinated by computers as I grew up but over time and after graduating, I discovered that coding/programming was so much more interesting to me. As such, I then started working towards becoming a software engineer by attempting self-learning, then switching to finding online courses that would help me learn and practice a programming language. Eventually I decided to focus on Python, and enrolled in a coding bootcamp to gear me towards being a Python Software Engineer but personally was always open to learning other languages or skills that are needed or recommended to me.

            Outside of work or learning, I mainly focus on gaming as that’s what I enjoy doing but interacting with friends is always another option for myself as company is nice too. Being able to be in voice channels with friends to watch one play the game we all know is secretly fulfilling, and I’ve enjoyed just listening (or reading if the person using text) to what others talk about. I do not usually participate in the conversations, mostly because I prefer listening, but I still would join in if spoken to, or if I have something to add in. If a friend asks me for help with something, I’d do my best to either wrap up what I’m currently doing, or find out a time to aid them, same goes for when text conversations are done in private messages or in the Discord server. I do my best to check a few times throughout the day to check for any alerts or mentions, and whenever I notice a notification directly towards me, I’d attempt to respond as soon as possible to not leave someone hanging if it's important.

            </p>
            <p>
                A user app that tracks the unique fortunes the user has obtained.
            </p>
            <p>
                An app that requires a user to login, or register if new then login, and the user can collect fortunes at what pace they wish, from 1 - 3 at a time and be able to view their collection of unique fortunes they obtained. The collection is unique to each registered user so a user would need to collect all unique fortunes themselves, and display all obtained fortunes in order of their fortune_id from the database.
